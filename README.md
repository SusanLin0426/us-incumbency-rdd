# us-incumbency-rdd
Study of whether incumbency increases reelection chances in U.S. presidential elections. We build baseline OLS and Regression Discontinuity (linear and quadratic) models around a 50% vote-share cutoff, using state-level election outcomes by cycle. We discuss identification, omitted-variable concerns, bandwidth choice, and visualize discontinuities.
